XPath for VTD-XML 

1.0 Objective
 This document provides an overview of the XPath feature
supported in VTD-XML.

2.0 Sample Code
 
Let us begin by looking the code snippet showing XPath in 
action:
   
   try{
   	...
   	AutoPilot ap = new AutoPilot();
	ap.bind(vn);
	ap.declareXPathNameSpace("ns1",
	   "http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope");
	ap.selectXPath(
	   "/ns1:Envelope/ns1:Header/*[@ns1:mustUnderstand]");
	System.out.println("expr string is " 
		+ ap.getExprString());
	while(ap.evalXPath()!= -1){
		// application logic goes here
		...
	}
	ap.resetXPath();
	...
    }catch(XPathParseException e){

    }catch(XPathEvalException e){

    }...

Notice that the C# version works pretty much the same way. And the C
version also is quite similar.

3. API Overview

Basicly, AutoPilot added a few methods that allows for XPath 
selection and evaluation.

   * selectXPath() compiles XPath into internal data structure.
   * declareXPathNameSpace() maps prefixes of XPath expression 
     into corresponding URLs.
   * evalXPath() moves the cursor across node sets matched by 
     the xpath expression.
   * evalXPathToString() is a new function that allows one to
     evaluate XPath to a String
   * evalXPathToNumber() is a new function that allows one to
     evaluate XPath to a double
   * evalXPathToBoolean() is a new function that allows one to
     evaluate XPath to a boolean
   * resetXPath() reset the internal states of the XPath data 
     structure so it can be reused.

Two more exception types are defined.

   * XPathParseException is thrown if XPath expression string
     is not valid.
   * XPathEvalException is thrown if there is error during XPath
     evaluation.

Notice that when using evalXPath(), users must be sure that
the cursor object doesn't change positions, one way this can 
be done is by using the combination of push() and pop().

	while(ap.evalXPath()!= -1){
		// application logic goes here

		// one must be sure that cursor position
		// enter the loop equals that exiting the
		// the loop
		...
	}

Also notice that the following always returns true
        int i; 
	while((i=ap.evalXPath())!=-1){
            // i always equals vn.getCurrentIndex()!!!!
	    if (i==vn.getCurrentIndex()){
	    }
	}


Because in many cases, XPath expression is compiled well before 
XMLs are actually processed, so autoPilot must support delayed 
binding of VTDNav object, which is supported by the following
methods.

   * AutoPilot has a new, argumentless constructor that does not 
     initially bind to an VTDNav object.
   * bind() allows the autoPilot to bind to a VTDNav object.

Union Expression support was introduced in version 1.7.

4. Limitation

   The list of built-in XPath functions supported in this release:

   *last
   *position
   *count
   *sum
   *floor
   *ceiling
   *string-length,
   *round
   *true
   *false
   *boolean
   *not
   *string
   *lang
   *number
   *local-name (since v1.7)
   *name (since v1.7)
   *namespace-uri (since v1.7)
   *substring (since v1.8)
   *substring-after (since v 1.8)
   *substring-before (since v 1.8)
   *concat (since v1.8)
   *starts-with (since v1.8)
   *contains (since v1.8)
   *normalize-space (since v1.8)   

   2.0 functions
   *ends-with
   *abs
   *upper-case
   *lower-case
   *round-half-to-even
	
   * Mixed-content type is fully supported since 2.4.
   * Comments and processing instructions are fully supported.
   

5. Performance considerations
   There is no VTD-XML specific performance consideration of XPath.
   For example, "//" operator is quite expensive, last() is also
   quite expensive.
   
6. Future Work 
   In future releases more built-in functions will be implemented.

7. Example

   In the example directory, XPath versions of the orginal examples
are provided.
